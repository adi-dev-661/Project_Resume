    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>To prepare Gulab Jamun, start by making the sugar syrup. Combine 2 cups of sugar and 1.5 cups of water in a large pan, then heat over medium flame, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Add 4-5 crushed cardamom pods and a few saffron strands if desired, then let it simmer for 5-7 minutes until slightly sticky but not thick. Turn off the heat and add 1-2 teaspoons of rose water if using, then set the syrup aside, keeping it warm.</p>
    <p>Next, prepare the dough. In a bowl, mix 1 cup of crumbled khoya, 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour, and 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder. Knead the mixture into a smooth, soft dough, adding 1-2 tablespoons of milk gradually as needed. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 10-15 minutes. After resting, divide the dough into small portions and roll them into smooth, crack-free balls.</p>
    <p>For frying, heat ghee or oil in a deep pan over low to medium heat until moderately hot. Test by dropping a small piece of dough; it should rise slowly. Fry the dough balls in the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Stir gently and continuously for even cooking until the balls are golden brown. Remove them with a slotted spoon and place them on paper towels to drain excess oil.</p>
    <p>While still warm, add the fried gulab jamuns to the warm sugar syrup and let them soak for at least 2 hours to absorb the syrup and become soft. Serve the gulab jamuns warm or at room temperature, optionally garnished with chopped nuts. Enjoy your delicious homemade Gulab Jamun!</p>
